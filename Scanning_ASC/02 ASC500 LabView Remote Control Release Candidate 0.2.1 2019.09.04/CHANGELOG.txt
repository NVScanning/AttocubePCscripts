# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2018-11-06
### Added
 - The path mode functionality is now included again in the software package (refer to ###Fixed)
 - The LabVIEW controls and indicators now contain the corresponding unit if known.
 - Data coming from Spec or Permanent is now scaled and rescaled to numbers between 0.01 and 1000 for readability reasons. The unit will be adjusted.
 - Scan Data will not be rescaled as there might be to many data points.
 - Inputs with variable units can now be entered in 'basic units' (mV, Hz, ...). An internal C-function scales the entered value to the from the daisy-server required unit.
### Changed
 - Manual has been updated concerning the new handling of units and path mode
### Fixed
 - Path mode functionality has been reworked:
	- Defining a grid now works via three points (centre point, x-axis-point and y-axis-point)
	- Adding single points to the path list has been fixed
	- Now it is possible to start the path in a grid mode or single points mode. The user has to decide which mode should be chosen. 
### Removed
 - The VIs 'setZResolution' and 'setZSlewrate' has been deleted from the software package, as their C-DLL couterparts have already been removed.


## [0.1.1] - 2018-09-05
### Added
 - Ability to change the sampling time (avgTime) of a spectroscopy via the setspecparameters-Cluster
### Fixed
 - the calculation of the xy-position (function name "getXYPos") has been corrected


## [0.1.0] - 2018-07-12
### Added
 - VI that incapsultes a GoTo-feature for x- and y-axis (goToXYPos.vi)
 - Added the Sources "pos x", "pos y" and "counter"
### Changed
 - Entering a scan range in the scan parameters cluster now only adjustes the number of columns/lines (Pixelsize is unchanged)
 - In the autoapproach cluster it is now possible to select axis 0...7.
 - The example.vi does not set any values of the scanner but reads the current ones out
### Fixed
 - Pixelsize is now read out in correct unit (nm)
 - Now no data file is overwritten when saving data from more than one channel
 - setpoint variable from z control cluster is now scaled to correct unit
 - Fixed the error not accepting some unit settings of the External Transfer Function
 - xy maxrange is now read out in correct unit
 - The value for xymaxRange is now saved for x- and y- axis.
 - The data points coming from the spectroscopy engines now have the correct unit
 - The example.vi now detects changes in the z control cluster
### Removed
 - Varibale "Absolute" from the z control cluster has been removed
